## 1.0.0 2019-11-11

This release suppports unfragmented IPv4 packets (i.e. there's no IPv6
support and no support for reassembling IP fragments).

S1AP support is based on 3GPP TS 36.413 version 14.8.0. Currently,
only unencrypted Initial Context Setup Request and Response messages
are considered.
